# SuperAdmin Role & Permission Management - Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Database Schema Updates
- [ ] Create unified migration for permissions table with all required fields
- [ ] Update roles table migration with proper constraints
- [ ] Ensure foreign key constraints and cascading deletes
- [ ] Add indexes for performance

## Phase 2: Model Updates
- [ ] Update Permission model relationships and methods
- [ ] Update Role model to use custom implementation consistently
- [ ] Update AdminUser model role/permission methods
- [ ] Standardize all relationships across models

## Phase 3: Controller Development
- [ ] Create SuperAdmin/RoleController for unified role management
- [ ] Create SuperAdmin/PermissionController for permission management
- [ ] Add API endpoints for assign/revoke/update operations
- [ ] Implement backend verification (SuperAdmin only)

## Phase 4: Views and UI
- [ ] Create SuperAdmin dashboard role management views
- [ ] Build permission assignment interfaces
- [ ] Add user filtering by roles (SuperAdmin, Admin, Moderator, Agent, Driver, Company, Matching Officer, Verification Manager)
- [ ] Implement dynamic UI updates

## Phase 5: APIs and Middleware
- [ ] Add API routes for role/permission operations
- [ ] Update middleware for dynamic access control
- [ ] Implement permission caching and cache invalidation

## Phase 6: Seeding and Testing
- [ ] Create RolePermissionSeeder with sample roles and permissions
- [ ] Test role assignments and permission checks
- [ ] Verify access control reflects dynamically
- [ ] Test user filtering functionality

## Phase 7: Integration and Verification
- [ ] Integrate with existing admin/superadmin systems
- [ ] Test full CRUD operations
- [ ] Verify backend verification logic
- [ ] Performance testing and optimization
