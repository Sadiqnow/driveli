# Phase 5: Database Migration & Schema Consolidation

## Week 1: Foundation & Safety âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Create migration backups table for safe rollback
- [x] Enhance countries table with ISO codes, phone codes, currency data
- [x] Enhance states table with state codes and country relationships
- [x] Enhance local governments table with LGA codes and state relationships
- [x] Enhance banks table with bank codes, SWIFT codes, and country relationships
- [x] Create consolidated drivers table with comprehensive schema
- [x] Create data migration backup table for tracking changes
- [x] Create migration validation log table for integrity checks
- [x] Commit and push changes to migration/schema-consolidation-v1 branch

## Week 2: Data Migration & Consolidation
- [ ] Create data migration scripts for existing drivers data
- [ ] Implement backup procedures before data migration
- [ ] Migrate existing drivers to consolidated table
- [ ] Validate data integrity after migration
- [ ] Update foreign key relationships
- [ ] Clean up old driver tables (after validation)

## Week 3: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Create comprehensive migration tests
- [ ] Test rollback procedures
- [ ] Validate all foreign key constraints
- [ ] Performance testing on consolidated schema
- [ ] Data consistency validation
- [ ] Create migration rollback scripts

## Week 4: Production Deployment
- [ ] Final data validation
- [ ] Production backup procedures
- [ ] Staged deployment plan
- [ ] Post-migration monitoring
- [ ] Documentation updates
- [ ] Team training on new schema

## Migration Safety Checklist
- [x] Backup system established
- [x] Validation logging implemented
- [x] Rollback procedures documented
- [ ] Data migration scripts tested
- [ ] Foreign key constraints validated
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established

## Next Steps
1. Run migrations in development environment
2. Test data migration scripts
3. Validate foreign key relationships
4. Prepare rollback procedures
