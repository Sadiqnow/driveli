# Admin Registration Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ValidationService Missing Phone Field Support
**Problem**: The `validateAdminRegistration` method in `ValidationService.php` was missing validation rules for the `phone` field, but the registration form and controller expected it.

**Fix**: Added phone field validation to `app/Services/ValidationService.php`:
```php
'phone' => [
    'nullable',
    'string',
    'max:20',
    'regex:/^[\+]?[0-9\-\(\)\s]+$/',
],
```

### 2. AuthenticationService Missing Phone Field
**Problem**: The `registerAdmin` method was not passing the phone field when creating the AdminUser.

**Fix**: Added phone field to admin creation in `app/Services/AuthenticationService.php`:
```php
'phone' => $data['phone'] ?? null,
```

### 3. Validation Messages Inconsistency
**Problem**: Inconsistent validation messages between ValidationService and AdminRegistrationRequest.

**Fix**: Standardized validation messages to match AdminRegistrationRequest format.

## Files Modified

1. `app/Services/ValidationService.php`
   - Added phone field validation
   - Updated validation messages
   - Fixed name regex to allow apostrophes

2. `app/Services/AuthenticationService.php`
   - Added phone field to admin creation

## Testing

Created test files to verify fixes:
- `test_registration_fixed.php` - CLI test script
- `public/test_admin_reg.php` - Web-based test form

## How to Test

1. **Web Interface**: Visit `http://localhost/drivelink/admin/register`
2. **CLI Test**: Run `php test_registration_fixed.php`
3. **Debug Form**: Visit `http://localhost/drivelink/public/test_admin_reg.php`

## Registration Requirements

The admin registration now properly validates:
- Name: Letters, spaces, hyphens, apostrophes, and dots (2-255 chars)
- Email: Valid email format, unique in admin_users table
- Password: Min 8 chars, must contain uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character
- Password Confirmation: Must match password
- Phone: Optional, accepts international formats with +, -, (), and spaces

## Notes

- Registration is currently enabled for development (AuthenticationService line 221)
- First admin user gets "Super Admin" role automatically
- Subsequent users get "Admin" role by default
- All new admins are created with "Active" status
