# Driver KYC System Testing Checklist

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive testing checklist for the Driver KYC (Know Your Customer) verification system. The KYC process consists of 3 steps:
1. **Step 1**: Personal Information
2. **Step 2**: Contact & Address Information
3. **Step 3**: Employment & Document Upload

## Critical Bugs Found

### 🔴 **High Priority Bugs**

#### 1. **Commented-out canPerformKyc() Method**
- **Location**: `app/Models/Drivers.php` (around line 1350)
- **Issue**: The `canPerformKyc()` method is commented out, causing inconsistent behavior
- **Impact**: KYC access control may not work properly
- **Status**: ❌ **CRITICAL - Needs immediate fix**

#### 2. **Duplicate Fillable Fields**
- **Location**: `app/Models/Drivers.php` fillable array
- **Issue**: Fields like `emergency_contact_name`, `emergency_contact_phone`, `kyc_status`, `kyc_rejection_reason` appear multiple times
- **Impact**: Mass assignment conflicts and unpredictable behavior
- **Status**: ❌ **CRITICAL - Needs immediate fix**

#### 3. **"NaN" Display Issues**
- **Location**: Various blade templates (step_1.blade.php, step2.blade.php, step3.blade.php)
- **Issue**: JavaScript errors causing "NaN" to display in forms
- **Impact**: Poor user experience, form validation failures
- **Status**: ❌ **HIGH - Needs fix**

#### 4. **driver_locations Table Schema Mismatch**
- **Location**: Model relationships in `Drivers.php`
- **Issue**: Relationships expect `state_id`, `lga_id`, `location_type`, `is_primary` columns, but table may not have them
- **Impact**: `getVerificationCompletionPercentage()` throws QueryException
- **Status**: ❌ **HIGH - Database schema needs verification**

#### 5. **Inconsistent kyc_step Types**
- **Issue**: Some code treats `kyc_step` as integer, others as string
- **Impact**: Logic errors in step progression
- **Status**: ❌ **MEDIUM - Needs standardization**

#### 6. **File Upload Path Issues**
- **Location**: Step 3 document upload
- **Issue**: File storage paths may be incorrect or insecure
- **Impact**: Document uploads may fail or be inaccessible
- **Status**: ❌ **MEDIUM - Needs verification**
