generate how to measure the system uptime with 10000 concurrent users per second using SQL:
    -   To measure system uptime with 10,000 concurrent users per second using SQL, you can create a table to log user activity and then query that table to calculate uptime. Below is an example of how you might set this up:
```sql
-- Step 1: Create a table to log user activity  
CREATE TABLE UserActivity (
    UserID INT,
    ActivityTime DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);  
-- Step 2: Simulate user activity logging (this would typically be done by your application)
-- For demonstration purposes, we will insert records to simulate 10,000 users logging in per
-- second. In a real scenario, this would be handled by your application logic.
-- INSERT INTO UserActivity (UserID) VALUES (1), (2), ..., (100 00); 
-- Repeat this every second to simulate continuous activity.
-- Step 3: Create a function to calculate uptime
CREATE FUNCTION CalculateUptime()
RETURNS FLOAT
BEGIN
    DECLARE totalSeconds INT;
    DECLARE activeSeconds INT;

    -- Calculate total seconds in the monitoring period (e.g., last hour)
    SET totalSeconds = 3600; -- 1 hour

    -- Calculate active seconds based on user activity
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT DATE_FORMAT(ActivityTime, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s')) INTO activeSeconds
    FROM UserActivity
    WHERE ActivityTime >= NOW() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR;

    -- Calculate uptime percentage
    RETURN (activeSeconds / totalSeconds) * 100;
END;    
-- Step 4: Query the uptime
SELECT CalculateUptime() AS SystemUptimePercentage; 
```
    -   This SQL code sets up a basic framework for logging user activity and calculating system uptime based on that activity. In a real-world scenario, you would need to implement the user activity logging in your application to ensure that it accurately reflects the number of concurrent users.00);
-- Repeat this every second to simulate continuous activity.
-- Step 3: Create a function to calculate uptime

    DECLARE totalSeconds INT;
    DECLARE activeSeconds INT;

    -- Calculate total seconds in the monitoring period (e.g., last hour)
    SET totalSeconds = 3600; -- 1 hour

    -- Calculate active seconds based on user activity
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT DATE_FORMAT(ActivityTime, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s')) INTO activeSeconds
    FROM UserActivity
    WHERE ActivityTime >= NOW() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR;

    -- Calculate uptime percentage
    RETURN (activeSeconds / totalSeconds) * 100;
END;
