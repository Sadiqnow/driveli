## Technical Standards & Best Practices

### Code Quality Standards
```php
// Follow PSR-12 coding standards
// Use meaningful variable and method names
// Implement proper error handling
// Write self-documenting code with minimal comments
// Follow SOLID principles
// Use dependency injection over static calls
```

### Laravel-Specific Practices
- **Models**: Use fillable/guarded properties, implement relationships, utilize scopes

- **Indexes**: Add appropriate database indexes for performance
- **Foreign Keys**: Maintain referential integrity
- **Soft Deletes**: Implement when data preservation is required

### Security Implementation
- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs using Form Requests
- **CSRF Protection**: Ensure all forms include CSRF tokens
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Use Eloquent ORM and parameter binding
- **XSS Prevention**: Escape output data properly
- **Authentication**: Implement secure login/logout mechanisms
- **Authorization**: Use Gates and Policies for access control

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components and methods
- **Feature Tests**: Test complete user workflows
