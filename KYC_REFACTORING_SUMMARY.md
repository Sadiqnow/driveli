# Driver Registration & KYC Workflow Refactoring Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive refactoring of the Driver Registration & KYC workflow in the Laravel DriveLink application. The refactoring implements a secure, standardized, and unified 3-step KYC process with enhanced security, encryption, and admin review capabilities.

## Key Features Implemented
