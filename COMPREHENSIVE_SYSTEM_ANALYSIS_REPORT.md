## Security Assessment

### 🟢 Security Strengths

1. **Multi-Layer Authentication System**
   - Admin, Driver, Company, and API guards properly configured
   - Laravel Sanctum for API authentication
   - Session-based authentication for web interfaces
   - Password reset with user enumeration protection

2. **Password Security**
   - Bcrypt hashing with appropriate rounds (12)
   - Password complexity requirements (12+ characters)
   - Secure password reset flow with tokens
   - Rate limiting on login attempts

3. **Input Validation & Sanitization**
   - Comprehensive validation in controllers
   - XSS protection with `htmlspecialchars()`
   - SQL injection prevention through Eloquent ORM
   - CSRF protection middleware enabled

4. **File Upload Security**
   - File type restrictions (jpg, jpeg, png, pdf)
   - File size limits (10MB)
   - Proper file validation

### 🔴 Critical Security Issues

1. **Missing Services Dependencies**
   - AdminAuthController references non-existent services:
     - `AuthenticationService`
     - `ValidationService` 
     - `ErrorHandlingService`
   - This could cause runtime errors in authentication flows

2. **Hardcoded Configuration**
   - Some security configurations in `.env.example` may not be properly validated
   - Missing environment-specific security headers

### 🟡 Security Warnings

1. **Session Security**
   - Default session configuration may not enforce HTTPS in production
   - Session timeout could be more restrictive for admin users

2. **API Security**
   - API rate limiting not explicitly configured in routes
   - Missing API versioning strategy

3. **User Enumeration**
   - While password reset has protection, registration flows may reveal existing users

### Security Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Implement missing service classes or remove dependencies
   - Add API rate limiting middleware
   - Configure HTTPS enforcement for production

2. **Short-term Improvements:**
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) system
   - Add two-factor authentication (2FA)
   - Implement session security headers

3. **Long-term Enhancements:**
   - Add security logging and monitoring
   - Implement API versioning
   - Add security audit trails
