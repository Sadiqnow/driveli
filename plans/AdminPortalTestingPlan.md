# Admin Portal Testing Plan

## 1. Full Frontend UI Testing

### Pages and Components to Cover:
- Admin login, registration, password reset pages
- Admin dashboard with statistics and recent activity feed
- Company request management pages (list, create, edit, approve/reject, queue management)
- Driver management pages (list, create, edit, KYC review, OTP verification, document management, OCR dashboard)
- Matching system pages (manual and auto matching, matches list, confirm/cancel matches)
- Notification center (compose, templates, history, delivery stats)
- Reports and analytics pages (commission, driver performance, financial reports)
- Commission management pages (list, mark paid, dispute, refund)
- Verification management pages (dashboard, driver details, approve/reject, reports)
- Company management pages (list, create, edit, verification, status toggle)
- Super admin pages (user management, audit logs, settings)
- Role and permission management (if enabled)
- Maintenance and fallback pages

### Testing Approach:
- Navigate through all pages and verify UI elements render correctly
- Test form inputs, validation messages, and submission flows
- Verify data displayed matches expected backend data
- Test interactive components like modals, dropdowns, filters, and pagination
- Check responsiveness and accessibility compliance

## 2. API Endpoint Testing

### Endpoints to Cover:
- Admin authentication (login, register, password reset)
- Dashboard stats and recent activity APIs
- Company request CRUD and action endpoints (approve, reject, cancel, bulk actions)
- Driver management APIs (create, update, delete, KYC actions, OTP verification, document uploads)
- Matching system APIs (auto/manual match, confirm/cancel match)
- Notification APIs (send, templates, history)
- Reports APIs (commission, driver performance, financial)
- Commission management APIs (mark paid, dispute, refund)
- Verification management APIs (approve, reject, retry, bulk approve)
- Company management APIs (create, update, verification)
- Super admin APIs (user management, role assignment, audit logs)
- Role and permission APIs (if enabled)

### Testing Approach:
- Test happy path scenarios for each endpoint
- Test validation errors and unauthorized access
- Test edge cases like bulk actions and pagination
- Use automated API testing tools (e.g., PHPUnit, Postman, or similar)

## 3. Performance and Security Testing

### Performance Testing:
- Load test key admin pages and APIs to measure response times and resource usage
- Identify and optimize slow queries or endpoints
- Test caching and database indexing effectiveness

### Security Testing:
- Verify authentication and authorization enforcement on all admin routes
- Test for common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF)
- Validate input sanitization and error handling
- Review audit logging and user activity tracking
